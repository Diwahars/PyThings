# P4E - [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data/)

**Description:** This course will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data.  
We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs. 
We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.  
This course will cover Chapters 11-13 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. 
To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two
